## Decision — Chat-first primary interaction (ACCEPTED)
- The normal way of interaction is through the chat.
- Users can upload receipts directly in chat (images/PDF), ask about a travel, add notes/info to a travel, and instruct the system to reassign receipts to another travel.
- The assistant should handle “take care” style intents end-to-end (capture → assign → clarify → confirm), with clear confirmations and an auditable trail.

## Implications
- All core flows must be operable via chat, with optional detail screens and lists for power tasks.
- The chat must support:
  - File/receipt upload with streaming OCR status and duplicate checks (assign/merge/dismiss) in-thread.
  - Natural-language commands for create/edit/move actions (e.g., “Move the taxi receipt from Berlin to Trip Q2 Sales Kickoff”).
  - Travel Q&A (status, totals, missing items), inline quick-fix actions, and “submit trip” with confirmation.
  - Manager approvals in chat (final-only) with approve/reject + note, respecting roles/permissions.
  - Safety: confirmations on destructive/ambiguous actions; audit log of intents ↔ actions; PII redaction on uploads.

## Requirement stubs to add (for Paulina)
- E-003 Navigation & IA
  - R-0XX Chat as primary entry: Chat is accessible globally; decision on default landing pending (see Q1).
- E-004 Capture
  - R-0XY Conversational capture & upload: send files to chat; show processing state; assign to trip/day; handle duplicates.
  - R-0XZ Chat-based receipt reassignment and edits.
- E-006 Review & Submission
  - R-0XA Chat Q&A and readiness checklist; “submit trip” via chat with confirmation.
- E-007 Approvals
  - R-0XB Final-only approvals in chat (approve/reject + note) with audit.
- E-001 Foundation
  - R-0XC Chat privacy/session/PII redaction; error/retry messaging in-thread.
- E-010 Flow Orchestration
  - R-0XD Intent→BPMN mapping with idempotency and audit linking chat threads to flow tasks.

## Open Question (Q1)
- Should chat be the default landing view (home) on both mobile and desktop? Options below; awaiting confirmation.

## Options & Recommendation (for this decision)
- A) Chat as default home (mobile + desktop); detail pages secondary. [Recommended]
- B) Split: Chat default on mobile, Workbench default on desktop; user-toggle remembered.
- C) Chat co-equal (not default); users open it via FAB/rail.

## Next
- After Q1 is answered, hand off to Paulina to add/rename requirement IDs and acceptance criteria, and to Matthias to define a “Conversational capture & commands” userflow under E-004/E-003.

## Decision Update (2025-08-09 09:02) — Q1 resolved
- Option A selected: Chat is the default home on mobile and desktop; detail screens are secondary. Remember last-used view per user.

## Next (updated)
- Paulina: implement requirement IDs and AC for chat-first entries (Navigation & IA, Capture, Review/Submission, Approvals, Foundation, Flow Orchestration).
- Matthias: draft userflow “Conversational capture & commands” under E-003/E-004.
- ReviewTeam: verify coverage and export after updates.
