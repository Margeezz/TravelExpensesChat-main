## E-009 Vendor Integration Layer - FINAL DECISIONS

### Vendor Strategy
- **Approach**: Hybrid model (Option A) - our UI/engine + vendor travel/cards + optional vendor OCR fallback
- **Primary Vendors**: TravelPerk (travel), Rydoo (expenses), Spendesk (cards/spend)
- **System of Record**: Per-diems, policy, approvals, settlement = OUR SYSTEM
- **OCR Strategy**: OUR OCR primary, vendor OCR as fallback only
- **Approvals**: Vendor approvals DISABLED, route via our flow engine

### Technical Implementation
- **Event Schema**: Standardized across vendors with vendor-specific extensions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Our OCR primary, vendor OCR as fallback
- **Idempotency**: Vendor event ID + timestamp deduplication
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) with DLQ after 3 attempts
- **Success Metrics**: 95% webhook delivery success rate, <2s processing time

## Cross-Epic Integration - FINAL DECISIONS

### Integration Strategy
- Clear API contracts between epics
- Fallback scenarios for partial system failures
- Integration testing before epic completion
- Shared data models and interfaces

### Success Criteria
- 80% user adoption (complete expense cycle)
- 95% receipt classification accuracy
- <2s response time for user actions
- 50% reduction in expense processing time

## Next Steps
- **Stefan**: Decisions documented and confirmed
- **Paulina**: Recreate all requirements based on these decisions
- **Paulina**: Review and update epic breakdown if needed to cover everything

## Notes
- All technical decisions are final and ready for implementation
- Focus on MVP scope - no payment processing in E-011
- Admin configuration should be user-friendly for non-technical users
- Vendor integration follows hybrid approach with clear ownership boundaries
