## Decision — No dedicated Capture page/tab (chat-only capture)
- Chat is the main and only surface for uploading receipts/documents.
- The chat composer must support camera (mobile) and gallery/files (mobile/desktop) directly.
- There is no separate "Capture" page or tab in navigation.

## Implications
- Navigation (E-003): Update tabs/rail to include Chat (primary), remove Capture. Remember last-used view.
- Capture (E-004): All capture flows operate inside chat. Any upload queue/progress is shown inline in-thread or as an in-chat panel/sheet, not a standalone page.
- Requirements to adjust:
  - E-003 R-001 Mobile Tabs → replace "Capture" with "Chat"; ensure global chat access.
  - E-004 R-001 File Picker + Camera Hint → scope to chat composer attach with mobile camera hint.
  - E-004 flows → deprecate standalone Upload Queue view or make it an overlay opened from chat only.
- Userflows to adjust:
  - UF-003 Navigation → Chat is default home; no Capture section.
  - UF-004 Capture & Upload → mark as optional in-chat panel; primary path is `UF-004-conversational-capture-and-commands`.

## Open question
- Do we keep an optional "Upload Queue" panel (overlay from chat) for batch controls and troubleshooting, or remove it entirely? (A) Keep as optional overlay [recommended]; (B) Remove entirely.

## Next
- Paulina: update E-003 R-001 and E-004 R-001 scopes per above; mark standalone capture page as out-of-scope.
- Matthias: refine UF-003 and UF-004 to reflect chat-only capture and optional overlay.

## Decision Update (2025-08-09 02:31)
- Answer to open question: B) Remove entirely.
- Rationale: Multi-select in chat composer is sufficient; per-item progress and retries are presented in-thread. No separate queue/overlay needed.

## Next (updated)
- Paulina: update `E-003 R-001` to list tabs as Chat, Travels, Review, Approvals, Settings; remove references to Capture.
- Paulina: update `E-004 R-001` to explicitly bind picker/camera to chat composer; remove standalone page mentions.
- Matthias: update `UF-004-capture-upload-flow` to mark out-of-scope for MVP (chat-only) and ensure `UF-004-conversational-capture-and-commands` is the primary path.
