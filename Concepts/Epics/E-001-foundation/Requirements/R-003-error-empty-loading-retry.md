# R-003 Error/Empty/Loading & Retry

## Why
Provide clear, actionable feedback to users for all system states while maintaining a professional user experience.

## Behavior
- **Loading States**: Show skeleton screens for content loading with <100ms appearance
- **Empty States**: Provide helpful guidance when no data is available
- **Error Handling**: Display actionable error messages with clear next steps
- **Retry Logic**: Offer retry options for recoverable errors
- **User Guidance**: Provide context-specific help and support options

## Business Rules
- **Loading Threshold**: Show loading state after 100ms delay
- **Error Categories**: Distinguish between user errors, system errors, and network issues
- **Retry Limits**: Allow up to 3 retry attempts for recoverable operations
- **Support Integration**: Provide direct access to help and support for persistent errors
- **Data Preservation**: Preserve user input during error recovery

## Scenarios (BDD)
Scenario: Loading state appears quickly
Given a user navigates to a data-heavy page
When the page starts loading
Then a loading skeleton appears within 100ms
And shows the expected content structure

Scenario: Empty state with helpful guidance
Given a user accesses a section with no data
When the page loads
Then an empty state message appears with clear guidance
And provides actionable next steps to populate the section

Scenario: Recoverable error with retry option
Given a network request fails temporarily
When the error occurs
Then a clear error message is displayed
And a retry button is provided
And the user can attempt the operation again

Scenario: Persistent error with support escalation
Given an error persists after 3 retry attempts
When all retries are exhausted
Then a support escalation message is shown
And direct access to help resources is provided
And the error details are logged for support

Scenario: User input preserved during error
Given a user is filling out a form
When a network error occurs
Then the user's input is preserved
And they can retry without re-entering data
And clear guidance is provided on the error cause
