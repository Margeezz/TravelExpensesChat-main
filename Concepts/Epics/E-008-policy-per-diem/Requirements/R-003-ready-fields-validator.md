# R-003 Readyâ€‘Fields Validator

## Why
Ensure required fields are complete before submission with configurable validation rules.

## Behavior
- **Configurable Validation**: Required fields defined per policy through admin interface
- **Real-time Validation**: Show inline errors and how to fix during data entry
- **Submission Control**: Block submission until all required fields are Ready
- **Admin Configuration**: Finance Administrators can configure validation rules
- **Guided Setup**: Validation rules configured through guided admin wizard

## Technical Requirements
- **Dynamic Validation**: Policy-based field requirements configurable by admins
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate validation feedback with clear error messages
- **Admin Interface**: Integration with policy configuration UI
- **Validation Engine**: Flexible rule engine for different field types
- **Error Handling**: Clear guidance on how to resolve validation issues
- **Audit Trail**: Track validation rule changes and their impact

## Scenarios (BDD)
Scenario: Missing purpose blocks submission
Given a required field Purpose is empty
When attempting to submit
Then submission is blocked with a clear error message
And guidance is provided on how to fix the issue

Scenario: Admin configures validation rules
Given a Finance Administrator wants to add new required fields
When they use the guided validation configuration wizard
Then validation rules are applied with real-time testing
And all existing submissions are re-evaluated against new rules

Scenario: Dynamic validation updates
Given a validation rule is changed in the admin interface
When the change is applied
Then all active forms immediately reflect the new validation
And users receive updated guidance on required fields
