- Mapping vendor event types → our states

## Out-of-Scope (optional)
- Human task UI (covered in Approvals/Review)

## Requirements
- See structure and naming in `Workflow/Conventions.md`.
- Reference list (optional):
- R-001 BPMN Orchestration
- R-002 Idempotency & Retries
- R-003 Vendor Event Mapping
