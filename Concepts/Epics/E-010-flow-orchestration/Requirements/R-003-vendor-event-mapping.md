# R-003 Vendor Event Mapping

## Why
Translate vendor-specific events from TravelPerk, Rydoo, and Spendesk into our canonical states with standardized event schema to ensure consistent business process handling.

## Behavior
- **Vendor Coverage**: TravelPerk (travel), Rydoo (expenses), Spendesk (cards/spend)
- **Event Normalization**: Standardize events across vendors while preserving vendor-specific details
- **Business Process Integration**: Map vendor events to our business workflows seamlessly
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure all vendor data is processed consistently regardless of source
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all vendor event processing and mapping decisions

## Business Rules
- **Event Validation**: All vendor events must pass validation before processing
- **Mapping Consistency**: Same vendor event type always maps to same canonical state
- **Data Preservation**: Vendor-specific details must be preserved in canonical events
- **Error Handling**: Failed mappings must be logged and reported for resolution
- **Performance Requirements**: Event mapping completed within business SLA timeframes

## Scenarios (BDD)
Scenario: TravelPerk travel event mapped to canonical state
Given TravelPerk sends a "booking_confirmed" event
When mapping is applied
Then our system records "travel_confirmed" state consistently
And the event includes TravelPerk-specific booking details
And the mapping is logged in the audit trail
And business processes are triggered accordingly

Scenario: Rydoo expense event with OCR results
Given Rydoo sends an "ocr_completed" event
When mapping is applied
Then our system records "receipt_processed" state
And OCR confidence and extracted data are preserved
And the receipt is queued for user review
And the mapping success is confirmed

Scenario: Cross-vendor event correlation
Given events from multiple vendors for the same trip
When correlation IDs are matched
Then all events are linked to the same business process
And the complete trip picture is assembled
And duplicate processing is prevented
And business rules are applied consistently

Scenario: Vendor mapping version management
Given a mapping table update is required
When the new mapping is deployed
Then all existing events continue to work
And new events use the updated mapping rules
And the mapping change is logged in the audit trail
And business processes adapt to the new mapping

Scenario: Failed event mapping handling
Given a vendor event cannot be mapped to canonical state
When the mapping fails
Then the event is logged as failed
And an alert is generated for manual review
And the vendor is notified of the mapping issue
And business processes continue with other events
