# R-002 Idempotency & Retries

## Why
Prevent duplicates and ensure reliability with robust retry policies and clear escalation.

## Behavior
- **Idempotency**: Avoid processing the same vendor event more than once
- **Retry Logic**: Retries transient failures with increasing delays
- **Escalation**: After retries are exhausted, the event is flagged for manual follow-up
- **Reliability**: Processing is consistent and repeat-safe
- **Audit Trail**: Track retry attempts and final disposition

## Technical Requirements
- **Idempotency Keys**: Vendor event ID + timestamp deduplication
- **Exponential Backoff**: 1s, 2s, 4s retry intervals
- **Retry Limit**: Maximum 3 attempts before DLQ
- **DLQ Alerting**: Simple alert notification for failed events
- **Event Logging**: Append-only event log with retry history
- **Health Monitoring**: Basic counters for success, retry, and DLQ metrics

## Scenarios (BDD)
Scenario: Duplicate webhook ignored through idempotency
Given a webhook is delivered twice from the same vendor
When processing occurs
Then the second delivery is ignored due to idempotent handling
And the duplicate is logged for audit purposes

Scenario: Retry logic with backoff
Given a webhook processing fails
When retry logic is triggered
Then the system makes repeated attempts with increasing delays
And each retry attempt is logged with timestamp

Scenario: Event escalation after retries
Given a webhook fails after all retry attempts
When all retries are exhausted
Then the event is routed for manual review
And a notification is created for intervention

Scenario: Idempotency across vendor systems
Given events from multiple vendors
When processing occurs
Then each vendor's events are handled independently
And idempotency is maintained across all vendor integrations
