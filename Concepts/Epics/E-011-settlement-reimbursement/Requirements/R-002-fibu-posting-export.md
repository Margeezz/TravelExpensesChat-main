# R-002 CSV Payment Export

## Why
Enable finance team to export payment proposals for manual bank processing with complete data accuracy and compliance tracking.

## Behavior
- **Export Generation**: Create CSV files with all required payment information
- **Data Validation**: Ensure all required fields are populated before export
- **Format Compliance**: Generate bank-compatible CSV format for upload systems
- **Access Control**: Restrict export functionality to Finance role users only
- **Audit Trail**: Track all export activities with user attribution and timestamp
- **Performance Targets**: Up to 10k rows export completes in <10s p95; progress indicator shown; queue long-running jobs

## Business Rules
- **Required Fields**: Employee ID, name, amount, currency, bank account, payment date
- **Data Validation**: All required fields must be populated before export allowed
- **File Naming (Privacy)**: Filenames must not contain PII. Use pattern `payments_<yyyymmdd-hhmm>_<digest8>.csv`
- **Logging (Privacy)**: Mask PII fields in logs; include audit fields: userId, activeRole, action, entityId, timestamp; store file digest/hash
- **Access Control**: Only Finance role users can access export functionality
- **Export Handling**: Large exports are split into manageable files
- **Data Accuracy**: Export must reflect current payment status at time of generation

## Scenarios (BDD)
Scenario: Export payment CSV for bank processing
Given a finance user requests payment export
When the CSV is generated
Then it contains all pending payments in bank-compatible format
And includes employee, amount, and bank details
And the file is named with date and cycle identifier
And the export is logged in the audit trail

Scenario: CSV validation and completeness
Given a payment CSV is generated
When the finance team reviews the file
Then all required fields are populated
And the format is compatible with bank upload systems
And the total amounts match the system totals
And any validation warnings are clearly displayed

Scenario: Finance role access control
Given a non-finance user tries to export payments
When they attempt to access the export function
Then access is denied
And an appropriate error message is shown
And the access attempt is logged in the audit trail
And guidance is provided on how to request access

Scenario: Large dataset export handling
Given more than 10,000 payments need to be exported
When the finance user requests export
Then the system creates multiple CSV files
And each file is properly named and numbered
And a summary file lists all generated files
And the user is informed of the multi-file export

Scenario: Export with data validation errors
Given some payments have validation issues
When the finance user attempts to export
Then validation errors are clearly displayed
And the export is blocked until issues are resolved
And specific guidance is provided on how to fix each issue
And the user can see which payments are affected

Scenario: Export performance and privacy
Given a dataset of up to 10,000 rows
When the finance user requests export
Then the export completes within 10 seconds p95 with progress shown
And the filename follows `payments_<yyyymmdd-hhmm>_<digest8>.csv` without PII
And logs mask PII and include audit fields
