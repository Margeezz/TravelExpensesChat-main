# E-007 Approvals

## Intent
Provide a clear manager approval flow with preview for travelers and delegation support.

## In-Scope
- Final-only (single-step) approval model
- Default approver assignment = employeeâ€™s line manager from the directory (overrideable by IT Administrator)
- Manager view toggle for traveler preview
- Manager approval sheet: Approve/Reject (+ comment on reject)
- Delegation on inactivity

## Out-of-Scope (optional)
- Multi-step approval chains (beyond final-only)
- Vendor approvals (disabled; routed via flow engine)

## Requirements
- See structure and naming in `Workflow/Conventions.md`.
- Reference list (optional):
- R-001 Manager View Toggle
- R-002 Approval Sheet (Approve/Reject + Comment)
- R-003 Delegation on Inactivity
- R-004 Final-Only Approval Model
