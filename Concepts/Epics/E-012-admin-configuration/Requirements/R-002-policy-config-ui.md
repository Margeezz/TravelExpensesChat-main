Enable Finance Administrators to configure policy rules through import/export with versioning and validation.

## Behavior

- **Validation**: Real-time validation of coverage and conflicts
- **Rollback**: Version management with rollback capability
- **Setup Time**: Target <30 minutes for new admin configuration

## Technical Requirements
- **Import/Export**: Support for multiple file formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
- **Version Management**: Complete version history with rollback functionality
- **Validation Engine**: Real-time policy validation and conflict detection
- **Template System**: Pre-built policy templates for common scenarios
- **Bulk Operations**: Batch import/export for large policy sets
- **Audit Trail**: Complete change history with user attribution

## Scenarios (BDD)
Scenario: Import policy configuration with validation
Given an admin has a valid policy file
When importing it through the guided interface
Then the policy is validated for coverage and conflicts
And applied with versioning and rollback capability

Scenario: Policy version management and rollback
Given multiple policy versions exist
When an admin needs to rollback to a previous version
Then the rollback process is completed safely
And all changes are tracked in the audit trail

Scenario: Template-based policy setup
Given a new admin is configuring policies
When they select a template for their industry
Then the template is applied with customization options
And validation ensures all required fields are completed
